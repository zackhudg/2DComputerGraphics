# 2DComputerGraphics

This is a 2D graphics engine built for my 2D Computer Graphics course in the Fall of 2022, which converts provided vector images (see: apps/lion.inc, apps/cartman.475, etc) into rasterized images (see: expected/).

The assignments consisted of starter code provided by the professor, which was then edited, added to, or fixed by me for the assignment, and cumulitively developed this engine. All .cpp and .h files in the base directory are written by me.

To see the images programmed in to be generated, use the commands ``make && ./image`` in a unix terminal.
